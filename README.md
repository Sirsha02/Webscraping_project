# Academic Faculty Data Aggregation & Analysis via web-scraping
<br>
This comprehensive web scraping project was developed as part of the IDC409 - Data Science course curriculum, demonstrating end-to-end data engineering and analysis capabilities.
<br>
The project systematically extracts, processes, and analyzes faculty data from three premier educational institutions: IISER Kolkata, IISER Mohali, and IISER Thiruvananthapuram.
<br>
Implemented custom web scraping solutions using BeautifulSoup and Requests to handle diverse website architectures and data structures across all three institutions.
<br>
Developed robust data processing pipelines with Pandas for cleaning, normalization, and transformation of raw HTML into structured datasets.
<br>
Created advanced comparative analytics and interactive visualizations using Matplotlib and Plotly to uncover institutional patterns and faculty distribution trends.
<br>
Built SQLite databases for efficient data storage and querying, enabling scalable data management and reproducible analysis.

<br>
Key Outcomes: Automated data collection system, institutional benchmarking framework, and insightful visual analytics dashboard.
